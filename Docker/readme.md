| **End Effectors** | EG2-4C2 grippers/Dexterous hands | Integrated with robotic arm API |
| **Voice Module** | Fun M240 microphone array | Voice module V5.1 |

## ROS2 Distribution Support

| Distribution | Status | Recommended Use | Original R2D3 Support |
|--------------|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Foxy** | ✅ Supported | Original development, legacy systems | ✅ Native (Original target) |
| **Humble** | ✅ Supported | **Recommended** for new projects | ✅ Adapted |
| **Jazzy** | ✅ Supported | Latest features, cutting-edge | ✅ Adapted |

**Recommendation**: Use **Foxy or Humble** for the best balance of stability and features. The original R2D3 was designed for Foxy, and all packages have been adapted to work with newer distributions.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)

The **easiest and most robust** way to run R2D3 with automatic setup and persistent storage.

1. **Prerequisites:**
   ```bash
   # Install Docker and Docker Compose
   # Ubuntu/Debian:
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose-plugin
   
   # Alternative: Install Docker Desktop (includes Compose v2)
   # Or use the official Docker installation script
   
   # Add user to docker group
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   # Log out and back in for group changes to take effect
   ```

2. **One-Command Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Setup host environment and start default (Humble)
   make setup && make start
   
   # Or use the management script
   ./scripts/r2d3.sh start
   ```

3. **Choose Your Distribution:**
   ```bash
   # Start specific distribution
   make start DISTRO=foxy     # Original R2D3
   make start DISTRO=humble   # Recommended
   make start DISTRO=jazzy    # Latest (experimental)
   
   # Or with the script
   ./scripts/r2d3.sh start foxy
   ./scripts/r2d3.sh start humble
   ./scripts/r2d3.sh start jazzy
   ```

4. **Access the Environment:**
   ```bash
   # Open shell in running container
   make shell
   
   # Or specify distribution
   make shell DISTRO=foxy
   
   # Using the script
   ./scripts/r2d3.sh shell humble
   ```

### Option 2: DevContainer (IDE Integration)

Perfect for development with VS Code or Cursor IDE integration.

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Docker installed and running
   - VS Code or Cursor with Dev Containers extension

2. **Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Enable X11 forwarding and audio
   make setup
   ```

3. **Launch:**
   - Open this folder in VS Code/Cursor
   - Choose distribution config:
     - **Default**: `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` (Humble)
     - **Foxy**: `.devcontainer/devcontainer.foxy.json`
     - **Jazzy**: `.devcontainer/devcontainer.jazzy.json`
   - Click "Reopen in Container"

### Option 3: Direct Docker (Advanced)

For users who prefer direct Docker commands.

```bash
# Setup host environment
make setup

# Run specific distribution
./docker/run.foxy.sh    # Foxy
./docker/run.humble.sh  # Humble  
./docker/run.jazzy.sh   # Jazzy
```

## Troubleshooting

### Audio Issues
If you encounter audio problems:
```bash
# Restart PulseAudio on host
pulseaudio --kill
pulseaudio --start

# Check audio devices in container
aplay -l
```

### GUI Issues
If GUI applications don't display:
```bash
# Reset X11 permissions
xhost -
xhost +local:docker

# Check DISPLAY variable
echo $DISPLAY
```

### Container Build Issues
If the container fails to build:
```bash
# Clean Docker cache
docker system prune -a

# Rebuild container
docker build -t ros2-jazzy-audio .devcontainer/
```

## R2D3 Robot Usage

### Docker Compose Commands

The Docker Compose setup provides the most convenient way to manage R2D3:

```bash
# Management with Makefile (Recommended)
make help                    # Show all available commands
make setup                   # Setup host environment
make start                   # Start default (Humble) environment
make start DISTRO=foxy      # Start specific distribution
make shell                   # Open shell in running container
make logs                    # Show container logs
make stop                    # Stop environment
make restart                 # Restart environment
make build                   # Build images
make clean                   # Clean up everything
make status                  # Show container status

# Management with script
./scripts/r2d3.sh help      # Show help
./scripts/r2d3.sh start     # Start default environment
./scripts/r2d3.sh start foxy # Start Foxy environment
./scripts/r2d3.sh shell     # Open shell
./scripts/r2d3.sh stop      # Stop environment
./scripts/r2d3.sh clean     # Clean up

# Direct Docker Compose (Advanced)
docker-compose --profile humble up -d    # Start Humble
docker-compose --profile foxy up -d      # Start Foxy
docker-compose --profile jazzy up -d     # Start Jazzy
docker-compose down                       # Stop current
```
